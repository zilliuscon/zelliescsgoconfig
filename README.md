# zelliescsgoconfig
The autoexec.cfg in Zellie's Counter Strike Folder


You can download and edit it as you see fit, things like sensitivity, and your jump throw bind are obvious! 

Crosshair settings are labled as well. 


To install my config, go to CS:GO's properties, click browse local files, and go to csgo > cfg > and paste in the CFG file.
